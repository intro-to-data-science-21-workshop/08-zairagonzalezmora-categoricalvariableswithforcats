# Worshop 08. Categorical Variables with Forcats

This repository provides materials for the session *Categorical variables with forcats*, which is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the Hertie School, Berlin in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

## Summary

This tutorial will introduce you to the `forcats` package, a useful tool to work with categorical data through the manipulation of factors. This is relevant because R represents categorical data with factors.
